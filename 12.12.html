        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
        making it over 2000 years old. <br>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor 
        at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the 
        cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et 
        Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
         is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The 
         first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in 
         section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
          below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et 
          Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by 
          English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
